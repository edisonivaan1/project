CONDITIONALS - IF CLAUSES - INTRODUCTION:

Conditional sentences consist of two parts: the if clause which is a condition, and the main clause which is a result.

Example: If it rains, we will cancel the trip.
- "If it rains..." is the if-clause, the condition
- An if-clause begins with IF and has a subject and a verb
- "We will cancel the trip" - the main clause, the result

The word IF introduces a condition. This is something that may or may not happen depending on the circumstances. We don't know exactly if it is going to rain so we say: if it rains and what is the result of this condition? We will cancel the trip.

There is always a condition and a result. The if-clause introduces a condition. The main clause is the result of that condition. What happens in the main clause is conditional on what happens in the if-clause. In other words, the main clause only happens when the events in the if-clause happen.

ORDERING CONDITIONAL SENTENCES:
Note, there are two ways of ordering a conditional sentence:
1. We can use the condition comma + result with a comma after the condition
2. We could use result + condition without a comma between the two

Look at the original sentence: "If it rains, we will cancel the trip."
Notice how there is a comma after the verb 'rains' which is the last part of the if-clause. When the if-clause comes first in the sentence, we put a comma after it.

"If it rains, we will cancel the trip."
But, when the main clause comes first in the sentence, the comma is not necessary.
"We will cancel the trip if it rains."

Notice how there is no comma in this last sentence. You can use either order. They are both used and both correct.

TYPES OF CONDITIONALS:
The four main types of conditionals are: the zero conditional, the first conditional, second conditional and the third conditional. Sometimes these are called type 0, type 1, type 2, and type 3 conditionals. We will quickly introduce them in this lesson and go into more detail about each conditional in individual lessons.

ZERO CONDITIONAL:
Involves the present simple + the present simple. This is used for facts that are generally true or scientific facts. The condition always has the same result.

Examples:
- If you stand in the rain, you get wet. This is generally true.
- If you heat ice, it melts. This is a fact.

FIRST CONDITIONAL:
Involves the present simple + will or its negative won't + the verb. This is used to express a possible situation in the future. We are predicting a likely result in the future if the condition happens.

Examples:
- If it rains, we will cancel the trip. This is the likely result in the future if it rains.
- If you study, you will pass the exam. Again, I predict that this will happen in the future if you study.

SECOND CONDITIONAL:
Involves the past simple + would + the verb. This is used for hypothetical or unlikely situations. Also for unreal or improbable situations now or in the future.

Examples:
- If I won the lottery, I would travel a lot. It is unlikely that I will win the lottery, but in this hypothetical situation, this is what I would do.
- If they sold their house, they would be rich. It is unlikely that they will sell their house because they like living there. However, in the improbable situation of them selling the house, they would become rich.

THIRD CONDITIONAL:
Involves the past perfect + would have + the past participle. This is used when a person is imagining a different past, an imaginary situation that did not happen in the past.

Examples:
- If you had studied, you would have passed the exam. I imagine that if you had done this in the past, the result would have been different.
- If I hadn't been sick, I would have gone to your party. I'm imagining the situation of not being sick in the past, something that I cannot change now.

SUMMARY:
So, in general, zero conditional refers to fact, the first conditional and second conditional refer to the present or the future. However, second conditional sentences suggest it is less probable or imaginary. The third conditional refers to the past.

There are more than these four types of conditional sentences, though these are the ones that are used the most. We will look at other types in future lessons.

Remember, this is just an introduction to conditionals. We will now look at each of these four types of conditional sentences. I hope you found this lesson about conditionals useful.

PARTICIPLE ADJECTIVES INTRODUCTION:
Welcome back today's lesson is about participle adjectives. Participles come from verb so the word starts out as a verb something like interest and then you add an ing interesting that's the present participle and interested that's the past participle. I put those on the board right here so you can easily see them.

Structure: The present participle would be the verb plus the ing and the past participle would be the verb plus the ed most of the time sometimes it's e and sometimes the past participle is an irregular verb which you just have to learn.

RULE A - EMOTIONS:
So there are three ways to learn this. The first part is about emotions so I'll just put a right here it's about emotions. So if you have the emotion you would say for example I am interested I am interested and I put the ed on the end why because I have that emotion I am interested because the movie is interesting.

Now the movie doesn't have any emotions so the movie actually gives me the emotion so this is the rule:
- If you have the emotion it's ed
- If you have the emotion which means you have to be a person or an animal in order to have an emotion so you would have the ed on the end of those words that describe a person's emotions or an animal's emotions
- Ing is when something gives the emotion to you

Examples:
- I'm bored because the class is boring
- I'm confused because the directions were confusing

So the directions give me that feeling. The directions are confusing but I have the emotions so I am confused. So have the emotion ed give the emotion ing so that's the first difference between the past participles the second one or past and the present participles.

RULE B - WHEN THE OBJECT DOES THE VERB:
The second one I'll call this b is when the object does the verb. Let me do an example how about everyone everyone was sad on the losing team the team lost the game okay the losing team lost the game.

So the way that you do this one it's not going to be a lost team the team loses so what you do because this word is the object obj object okay everyone the losing team is the object this is the participle right here if the object does that verb then you put ing on the end.

Example:
- Did the team lose the answer is yes the team lost that's why everyone is said so the team it's a losing team

Whereas if you look at this one the children found the lost dog found the lost dog now this is not present participle this is the past participle as I said before some of these are irregular here's an irregular one.

- Did the dog lose the answer is no the Little Boy Lost the dog but the dog didn't lose so the object here obj the object did not do this verb and therefore it's in the past participle form

RULE C - TIMING:
The third part here if I have room to write this I think I do see okay the c is when something is happening at that time.

Examples:
- If the snow is falling you say the falling snow made everything look white
- But if the snow is already on the ground you would say the fallen snow is 30 cm deep

So the one is happening at the same time the falling snow is happening at the time that I'm saying that the fallen snow well it snowed yesterday it's not snowing today today so the falling snow the falling snow is oh let's just say beautiful the falling snow is beautiful it's falling right now.

So when this thing is happening right now it is the ing once again which I will circle ing okay so with those three little rules you can remember whether the partis is a present participle or a past participle bye for now.

VERBS FOLLOWED BY OTHER VERBS - INTRODUCTION:
English lessons today's mini English lesson is about verbs verbs followed by other verbs. Verbs can be followed by the infinitive to plus the base form to eat for example or gerunds verb plus the ing eating.

VERBS ALWAYS FOLLOWED BY GERUNDS:
So some verbs are always followed by gerunds enjoy I enjoy eating fresh croissants in the morning.

VERBS ALWAYS FOLLOWED BY THE INFINITIVE:
And some verbs are always followed by the infinitive I want to eat eggs in the bacon today want is an example of a verb always followed by the infinitive but how do we know which ones to use unfortunately for these verbs you just have to learn them sorry.

VERBS FOLLOWED BY BOTH WITH SLIGHT DIFFERENCE:
Then there are a group of verbs that can be followed by gerunds infinitives these verbs a little bit more complicated because there is a slight difference in meaning.

Examples:
- I like oh I love eating chocolate
- I love to eat chocolate with my coffee in the morning

If we say I love eating it's more general but if I say I love to eat then our specific moment.

VERBS THAT CHANGE MEANING:
The last group of verbs are verbs that can be followed by gerunds or infinitives but the meaning changes quite a lot stop stop is an example that can be used by both the difference is quite big.

Examples:
- I stopped eating so much cake because I was worried about my weight
- I stopped to eat another piece of cake

Here how do we know what the difference in meaning is I stopped eating we are looking backwards at the event where as I start to eat is looking forwards at the event.

RECAP:
Let's just recap there are three different types of verbs that can be followed by other verbs:

1. The first example we looked at there are verbs that are always followed by gerunds are always followed by infinitives
2. Then there are those verbs like lie and love which are sometimes followed by one or the other there is a little difference in meaning but basically they are very similar  
3. Then we have those verbs like stop who are very different meanings if we use them with gerunds or follow them by infinitives

I think you should remember to stop before you use a gerund or infinitive after reverb next time.

    MODALS AND ADVERBS OF CERTAINTY:
    We can use the models might may could must and the adverbs maybe perhaps possibly probably and definitely to express how sure we are about the meaning of signs and gestures.

    Examples:
    - Maybe it means he doesn't understand you
    - That must mean it's perfect

    Structure: To create sentences with models we need a subject the modal verb the verb mean and the complement.

    Examples:
    - In my mean she can't hear you
    - He may mean she can't hear you

    Important note: In this case we use might or may when you are not very sure about the meaning of this expression.

    - It could mean he doesn't know
    - It could mean he doesn't know

    Important note: We use could when we are like 50 sure about the meaning of the expression.

    - That must mean be quiet
    - That must mean be quiet

    Important note: We use mas when we are almost a hundred percent sure about the meaning.

    ADVERBS STRUCTURE:
    With adverbs we need a subject the adverb the verb mean conjugated for the third person and a compliment.

    Examples:
    - Maybe it means come here
    - Perhaps it means come here

    Important note: We use maybe and perhaps at the beginning of the sentence maybe and perhaps are the same you use maybe and perhaps when you are now very sure about the meaning of the expression.

    - It possibly means call me
    - It possibly means call me
    - It probably means call me

    Important note: When you are like 50 sure about the expression we use possibly or probably.

    - That definitely means you're crazy
    - That definitely means you're crazy

    Important note: Now if you are almost 100 sure we use definitely.

    PERMISSION, OBLIGATION AND PROHIBITION:
    To express permission obligation and prohibition we can use be allowed to can have to have got to can't and not be allowed to.

    Examples:
    - You can use the computers in the library you can use the computers in the library you have the permission
    - You have to take off your shoes before you enter you have to take off your shoes before you enter this is an obligation before you enter you have to do this action you have to take off your shoes so this is an obligation
    - You are not allowed to swim in this area you are not allowed to swim in this area you cannot do it you don't have the permission to do it

    PERMISSION STRUCTURE:
    To create sentences with permissions we need a subject allowed to or can plus a verb in the base form plus a complement.

    Examples:
    - You are allowed to go to the restroom you are allowed to go to the restroom
    - You can participate if you raise your hand you can participate if you raise your hand

    Important note: In this case you have the permission this is something that you can do if you want to.

    OBLIGATION STRUCTURE:
    To create sentences with obligations we need a subject have to or have got two plus a verb in the base form plus a complement.

    Examples:
    - You have to throw your trash into the wastebasket you have to throw your trash into the wastebasket
    - You have got to wear a face mask during the pandemic you have got to wear a face mask during the pandemic

    Important note: In this case it's an obligation you are forced to do this you don't have any other action.

    PROHIBITION STRUCTURE:
    To talk about prohibition we need a subject now we allow to or can't plus the verb in the base form plus a compliment.

    Examples:
    - You are not allowed to talk loudly inside the library you are not allowed to talk loudly inside the library
    - You can't smoke on the subway you can't smoke on the subway

    Important note: You are not allowed you don't have the permission to do this action.
